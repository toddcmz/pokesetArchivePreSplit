I took deoxys out of the pokemon list. Retrieving that pokemon
requires "deoxys-normal", which I think is strange, and I don't want
to deal with the resulting contortions that don't apply to anyone else.

Leaving the only other hyphenation that I know of: nidoran-f and nidoran-m.

It might be good to loop through the json list and make sure all the sprites
get returned.
